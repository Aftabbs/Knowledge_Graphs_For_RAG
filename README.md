# Knowledge_Graphs_For_RAG
This project explores the integration of **Knowledge Graphs** with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the accuracy, relevance, and depth of generative AI systems. Knowledge Graphs structure information into entities (nodes) and relationships (edges), enabling efficient storage, querying, and reasoning.
